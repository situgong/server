I will continue with the migration to WASM. To ensure the `bergamot-translator.wasm` file (likely compiled with Emscripten) can be executed by our Rust server, I need to inspect its imports first.

## 1. Inspect WASM Compatibility
- **Action**: Update `src/bin/inspect.rs` (which you have open) to load `wasm/bergamot-translator.wasm` and print its imports using `wasmtime`.
- **Goal**: Determine if the WASM module uses standard WASI imports (supported by `wasmtime`) or Emscripten-specific imports (which might require `wasmer` or special handling).

## 2. Implementation (`src/wasm_engine.rs`)
- Implement the `WasmEngine` struct.
- **If WASI**: Use `wasmtime` with `wasi-common`.
- **If Emscripten**: I may need to switch to `wasmer` (which has better Emscripten support) or mock the required environment imports in `wasmtime`. *I will assume standard WASI or manageable imports for now, but will adapt based on step 1.*

## 3. Integration
- Refactor `src/translation.rs` to use `WasmEngine`.
- Update `src/main.rs`.
- Configure the proxy (`$Env:http_proxy`) as suggested for any dependency downloads.

## 4. Verification
- Run the server and test translation.
